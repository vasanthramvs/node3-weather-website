Four stages :
untracked files - initial stages of all files
unstaged changes - files already in tracking of git (initially nothing will be here, only if any changes made to previously committed file, that will be stored here)
staged changes - git add command to add all file that's ready to be committed
commit - bundled for version controll

git init  => creates empty repo and all files will be in untracked files 
git status => shows untracked files
git add foldername/filename => pushes folder/file to staging area
git add . => adds everything to staging area
git commit => commits to git
git commit -m "Initial commit" => same as above but with a message


ls -a -l ~/.ssh 
ssh-keygen -t -rsa -b 4096 -C "gmailID"
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

git remote add origin githuburl  -> origin is the name we give, also we can change 

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  => copy all and paste in ssh key in github (in settings)
ssh -T git@github.com  +> give yes and enter
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
