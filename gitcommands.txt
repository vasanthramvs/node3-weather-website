Four stages :
untracked files - initial stages of all files
unstaged changes - files already in tracking of git (initially nothing will be here, only if any changes made to previously committed file, that will be stored here)
staged changes - git add command to add all file that's ready to be committed
commit - bundled for version controll

git init  => creates empty repo and all files will be in untracked files 
git status => shows untracked files
git add foldername/filename => pushes folder/file to staging area
git add . => adds everything to staging area
